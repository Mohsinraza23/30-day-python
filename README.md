### **Day 4: Conditional Statements**
**Task:** Check if a number is positive, negative, or zero.

number = float(input("Enter a number: "))
if number > 0:
    print("The number is positive.")
elif number < 0:
    print("The number is negative.")
else:
    print("The number is zero.")
```

### **Day 5: Loops - For Loop**
**Task:** Print the first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    fib = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n):
        fib.append(fib[i-1] + fib[i-2])
    return fib

print(fibonacci(10))
```
**Concepts:** Loops, lists, range(), append().

### **Day 6: Loops - While Loop**
**Task:** Calculate the factorial of a number using a while loop.
```python
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    while n > 0:
        result *= n
        n -= 1
    return result

number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
print(f"The factorial of {number} is {factorial(number)}")
```
**Concepts:** While loops, factorial calculation.

### **Day 7: Lists and List Comprehensions**
**Task:** Create a list of squares of even numbers from 0 to 20 using a list comprehension.
```python
squares = [x**2 for x in range(21) if x % 2 == 0]
print(squares)
```
**Concepts:** List comprehensions, range(), conditional filtering.

### **Day 8: Dictionaries**
**Task:** Count word occurrences in a given string using a dictionary.
```python
def word_frequency(sentence):
    words = sentence.lower().split()
    frequency = {}
    for word in words:
        frequency[word] = frequency.get(word, 0) + 1
    return frequency

sentence = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
print(word_frequency(sentence))
```
**Concepts:** Dictionaries, get() method, string methods.

### **Day 9: Functions and Default Arguments**
**Task:** Calculate the area of a rectangle with default values.
```python
def rectangle_area(length=1, width=1):
    return length * width

print(rectangle_area())
print(rectangle_area(5))
print(rectangle_area(4, 3))
print(rectangle_area(width=6))
```
**Concepts:** Functions, default arguments, keyword arguments.

### **Day 10: Error Handling**
**Task:** Handle division errors using try-except.
```python
try:
    num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
    num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
    result = num1 / num2
    print(f"The result of {num1} divided by {num2} is {result}")
except ValueError:
    print("Error: Please enter valid numbers.")
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Error: Cannot divide by zero.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
```
**Concepts:** Exception handling, multiple except blocks.

# Arithmetic Operators in Python

Python provides several arithmetic operators for mathematical computations. Below is a detailed explanation of each operator with examples.

## 1. Addition (`+`)
Adds two numbers.

```python
# Addition Example
a = 10
b = 5
result = a + b  # 15
print(result)
```

## 2. Subtraction (`-`)
Subtracts the second number from the first.

```python
# Subtraction Example
result = a - b  # 5
print(result)
```

## 3. Multiplication (`*`)
Multiplies two numbers.

```python
# Multiplication Example
result = a * b  # 50
print(result)
```

## 4. Division (`/`)
Divides the first number by the second (returns a float).

```python
# Division Example
result = a / b  # 2.0
print(result)
```

## 5. Floor Division (`//`)
Divides and rounds down to the nearest integer.

```python
# Floor Division Example
result = a // b  # 2
print(result)
```

## 6. Modulus (`%`)
Returns the remainder of the division.

```python
# Modulus Example
result = a % b  # 0
print(result)
```

## 7. Exponentiation (`**`)
Raises the first number to the power of the second.

```python
# Exponentiation Example
result = a ** b  # 10^5 = 100000
print(result)
```

### üìå Notes:
- The `/` operator returns a float, even if the division is exact.
- The `//` operator performs integer (floor) division.
- The `%` operator helps in finding remainders, useful in loops and conditions.
- The `**` operator is used for power calculations.

Happy Coding! üöÄ
