# Arithmetic Operators in Python

Python provides several arithmetic operators for mathematical computations. Below is a detailed explanation of each operator with examples.

## 1. Addition (`+`)
Adds two numbers.

```python
# Addition Example
a = 10
b = 5
result = a + b  # 15
print(result)
```

## 2. Subtraction (`-`)
Subtracts the second number from the first.

```python
# Subtraction Example
result = a - b  # 5
print(result)
```

## 3. Multiplication (`*`)
Multiplies two numbers.

```python
# Multiplication Example
result = a * b  # 50
print(result)
```

## 4. Division (`/`)
Divides the first number by the second (returns a float).

```python
# Division Example
result = a / b  # 2.0
print(result)
```

## 5. Floor Division (`//`)
Divides and rounds down to the nearest integer.

```python
# Floor Division Example
result = a // b  # 2
print(result)
```

## 6. Modulus (`%`)
Returns the remainder of the division.

```python
# Modulus Example
result = a % b  # 0
print(result)
```

## 7. Exponentiation (`**`)
Raises the first number to the power of the second.

```python
# Exponentiation Example
result = a ** b  # 10^5 = 100000
print(result)
```

### ðŸ“Œ Notes:
- The `/` operator returns a float, even if the division is exact.
- The `//` operator performs integer (floor) division.
- The `%` operator helps in finding remainders, useful in loops and conditions.
- The `**` operator is used for power calculations.

Happy Coding! ðŸš€
